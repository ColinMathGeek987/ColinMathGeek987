\title{distri Function - Binomial Simulation}
\usage{
distri(iter = 100, n = 10, p = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{Integer. The number of iterations (simulations) to perform.}

\item{n}{Integer. The number of trials in each simulation.}

\item{p}{Numeric (0 ≤ p ≤ 1). The probability of success in a single trial.}
}
\value{
A named vector of relative frequencies of successes. The function also generates a bar plot displaying the distribution of successes.
}
\description{
Performs a binomial distribution simulation and returns the relative frequencies of successes along with a bar plot.
}
\details{
This function creates a matrix to hold samples, calculates the number of successes in each trial, and generates a bar plot displaying the distribution of successes.
